## Overview

Circumspect is an Android application designed to trace and monitor the processes running on an Android device. The app helps developers and security professionals understand how apps and processes are interacting with the system by providing real-time insights into resource usage, network activity, and more. It is a valuable tool for debugging, performance tuning, and security auditing.

## Features

- Trace running processes on Android devices in real-time.
- Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage of processes.
- Track resource consumption by individual apps.
- Lightweight, user-friendly interface for easy monitoring.
- No root access required (with limited functionality on unrooted devices).
- Option to export logs for detailed analysis.

## Installation
